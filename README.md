# 👽 Alien Invasion

#### One of the many clones of the popular 1978 arcade game Alien Invaders, created using the Python Crash Course book, then tweaked to add a more personal touch. 

# 🛸 Introduction

>In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys ← and → and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
